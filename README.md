ARK (stylised as A.RK [or Amaze.RK]) is a movie site (currently under development).

A project by Owen Voke. The sole contributor, all software is open source. Soon to be integrated into PXIMG.

I am currently using the OMDB API and the TV Maze API.
Please see the [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/PXgamer/A.RK/wikis/home) for more information.

This is just a project I am doing in my spare time and not really for any purpose other than learning more about C#.
